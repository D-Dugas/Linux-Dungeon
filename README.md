This game was created by me (Dalen Dugas) as a final project for my Linux Scripting course taken during my Cyber Security degree. Its purpose was to challenge myself and create something I'd be proud to add to my portfolio. When thinking of what I was going to create, I had many ideas, but one in particular kept sticking out to me. I thought to myself, wouldn't it be awesome to create a game using Bash that could be used to both learn, and remember Bash? That's when I started to think of the old DOS text adventure games, and realized I could create one of those myself to serve this purpose, and so, here we are!
